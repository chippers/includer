# Example Web App

Note: Here `web/dist` isn't ignored by git for the sole purpose of not needing
to run node to build the example.  Normally, you should be generating that for
your platforms and not keep it in version control.

## Building

Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` inside of the `web` subdirectory to build
the web portion of this example project.
